# Recursive binding is only needed for self-referential functions.
# These are plain (non-recursive) function values and applications.

let inc = 位x. x + 1 in     # a simple increment function
let apply = 位f. 位y. f y in # apply takes a function and returns a 位 that applies it
let incOnce = apply inc in # same as increment
